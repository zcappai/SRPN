# SRPN
The SRPN (Saturated Reverse Polish Notation) calculator is a reverse polish notation calculator with the extra feature that all arithmetic is saturated i.e. when the maximum value that can be stored in a variable is reached, then the variable remains at that maximum value rather than wrapping around.

This investigative project involved the creation of an SRPN calculator by replicating an SRPN calculator that was provided by lecturers, including exact error messages. But, the code of the provided SRPN calculator was <strong><u>not</u></strong> visible or accessible, and therefore, therefore the functionality could only be replicated by:
1. Providing the calculator with inputs
2. Reading the outputs for the given inputs
3. Deducing the functionality
